Since then, some topics I\u2019ve become   interested in include operating systems, networks, distributed computing,   programming languages, and compilers; all of which I enjoy because I love   the challenge of thinking about how to build things well and how to manage   something that has been built. Outside of Computer Science, I enjoy playing   with my ukulele, dancing, and going outdoors.I am also extremely concerned with issues of diversity and inclusivity, so   if you have any questions about being MOGAI/LGBTQIA+ in tech or in general,    please feel free to contact me (my cal poly username is mlam07)."}, "Kevin Ly": {"description": "I am a 5th year student pursuing a Masters Degree in Computer Science in   the 4 + 1 Program.
