Strategy/Data Sources:

-Wrote web scrapers to get data and script to aggregate everything
-Defined large nested dictionary to contain aggregation of data
-Grouped known questions and narrowed variety of responses
-Implemented variable replacement to recognize important terms (club,tutor,etc.)
-Utilize combination of Levenshtein distance and tf*idf to match input
    question to known question
-Mapped known questions to functions that access stored data

Weaknesses/Problems:

-Dataset not very complete (clubs don't put much info online)
-Manual mapping from questions to functions
-Not currently handling new questions, only matching to known
-No followup questions or memory
